# AISC-Beginner-Project
Team 2's Data Science Project for AISC's Beginner Sprints

This project originates from @sukhman-singh-1612's data science project repository, which was provided to us by AISC. 

We chose the Sleep Disorder Prediction project to study over 5 weeks for the beginner project sprints. We performed data analysis, delving into the complex dynamics influencing sleep disorders, focusing on the relationships between gender, occupation, BMI, and sleep quality. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, we imported libraries to create data frames to display our data, as shown in the original project but with different HEX color codes for our desired project aesthetic. The steps are as follows:

1. Import libraries (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
2. Read the downloaded file and display the data set.
3. Create count plots and histograms to display 9 unique graphs (3x3 matrix), representing variables and findings.
